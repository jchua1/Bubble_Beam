APCS1 Final Project

This game is a text-based RPG based off of the Pokemon franchise. The player chooses a starter Pokemon and begins his/her journey through the Kanto region. In each city, the player will be prompted to choose one of 3 options. The player can either battle the gym leader to progress to the next city, train in the wilderness in order to get xp and catch pokemon, or the player can go to the pokemon center to heal pokemon/edit party. There are 8 cities each with a gym leader to defeat. After beating all 8, the game is finished.
