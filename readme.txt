This game will be a text-based RPG based off of the Pokémon franchise. 
After playing the tutorial, the player will be asked to choose a starter 
Pokémon and begin the journey. The goal of the game is to defeat all of the 
gym leaders (specific number has not yet been decided) and win the 
championship cup. The player will progress from city to city until they 
have beaten all the gym leaders. Each new city will have a wilderness area 
where the player can catch new Pokémon or train his or her existing Pokémon.
When the player feels that he is ready, he or she will be allowed to 
challenge the city’s gym. If the player is successful in defeating the gym, he 
or she will progress to a new city with a harder gym and new Pokémon to fight 
and capture. Once all the gyms have been conquered, the player will fight in the
champion cup, a series of battles designed to test the strength of the player’s 
team. The game is over when the player wins the cup. The player will have the 
option to save his or her game in order to continue playing at a later time.
